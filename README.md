# Extract Builderment Vault Images

Hello there! I made this Discord bot to extract all images from [The Builderment Vault](https://discord.gg/CTYyMPrv5x) and use it in my [Builderment Builds](https://space-yg.github.io/builderment-builds/) website. This is due to Discord changing its policy regarding accessing Discord images from outside of Discord. Now there is an expiry date for each image you copy its image link from Discord, so you can't use the image in the long run. I had to download all the images, save them on the website, and use them.

If you have any question, don't hesitate to open an issue!
